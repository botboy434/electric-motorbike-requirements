This is a repo that I have created to document my progress on designing an electric motorbike, compliant to all of the Australlian design rules

Also now includes a basic 3d model that you can use!



Before you start building you need to consult with an Automotive/Engineering Consultiant about your project!!

I am **not** acountable for you failing to comply with your local regulations, this repo is provided as is.
